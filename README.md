# Preset Party

Multiplattform GUI application for sharing and caring presets. Ready to run [binaries for all platforms on the release tab](https://github.com/polarity/preset-party-app/releases).

## What is it now?
A standalone application cloning & updating the [preset github](https://github.com/polarity/bitwig-presets) into your bitwig preset directory (it creates a sub directoy called preset party).

## How to submit presets?
- via github pull requests
- via discord (just [upload](https://discord.gg/0g2ZPafIN3eWParf) in the preset channel)

## What will it become?
- it will get a login so you can submit presets in the app itself
- it will open up for more daws & plugins & repos (you can subscribe to creators)
